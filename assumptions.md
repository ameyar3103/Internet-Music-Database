Following are the few assumptions we used in designing our website:

    (a) all of our webpages are created on a 14 inch laptop with 1920 X 1080 resolution, while a lot of our pages use flex but a certain chunk doesn't. so to get the best possible view of the website and its elements, we'd recommend you to 'zoom-out' a little bit if the dimensions of your screen is larger than 14 inches, and similarly 'zoom-in' if its smaller than 14 inch.

    !! (the above one is quite an important assumption) !!

    (b) for a couple of artists, there weren't 5 albums, although they did have more songs but mostly singles...so to counter that we combined few singles into a new album. though, this is done only for 1 singer and that too only once.
